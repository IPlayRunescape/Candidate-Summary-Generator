# Candidate Summary Generator

Generates a paragraph description for information given about a candidate


## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Need to have python3 installed and able to run from a command line

### Installing

* Clone or download the project

### Executing program

* Navigate to the project in terminal, type python3 generate.pyz to run the program

## Help

Can only be run once, has to be restarted if a new prompt wants to be generate (hopefully fixed later)

To regenerate the executable, run this command `python3 -m zipapp -o generator.pyz -m "main:main" Candidate-Summary-Generator`

Here, I am in the directory above the program in order to capture all of the dependencies in the source. 
This could be improved by moving the source code files into a separate folder.
